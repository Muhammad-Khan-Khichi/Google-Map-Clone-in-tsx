✅ Now your README has a **"Live Demo" button** right under the title, so anyone visiting your repo can click it and see the deployed site.  

Would you like me to also add a **GitHub Actions workflow** snippet so your site auto-deploys every time you push to `main` (no need to run `npm run deploy` manually)?



# Install dependencies
npm install

# Run development server
